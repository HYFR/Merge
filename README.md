# Merge
Contains the merge sort algorithm. The merge sort algorithm executs a divide and conquer method that divides unsorted sub-arrays until each contain one element. Then the algorithm merges the sub-arrays into newly sorted arrays until there is only one sorted array.

## Setup
First you will want to compile the main function.
```
make main
```

Then you will want to run the file
```
./main merge 4 3 2 1
```

The output will be displayed on the terminal.
```
Sorted list in ascending order:
1 2 3 4
```
